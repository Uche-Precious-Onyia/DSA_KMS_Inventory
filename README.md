## DSA_KMS_Inventory
This is my second practice project under the DSA program. Here, I will be working with a hypothetical business outfit, Kultra Mega Stores (KMS).

Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in ofﬁce supplies and furniture. I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of KMS and provide my key insights and ﬁndings based on the excel dataset received. 

My tool for analysis is MS SQL server.
### Project Topic
Kultra Mega Stores Inventory
### Project Overview
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in ofﬁce supplies and furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria. 

I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of KMS. The Business Manager has shared an Excel ﬁle containing order data from 2009 to 2012 and has requested that I analyze the data and present my key insights and ﬁndings.
### Data Source
Two datasets were provided for this project- Order_status [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tq8ccM4LoX50BPxkpfXaaCrlXFx5P_6Y/view?usp=sharing) and KMS Sql Case Study [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9In-lAhoTUIC4WcVwgtKcCFesi7O2Rg/view?usp=sharing)

These files contain information on things like **customer name**, **customer segment**,  **sales**, **profit**, etc., all collected between the years 2009 and 2012, and which will prove useful for our analysis.
### Tools Used
- Excel for data collection
- Microsoft word (for documenting steps and findings)
- SQL server (for querying and analysis)
- Microsoft PowerPoint(for presentation of findings)

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Database creation: A new database called KMS_db was first created on my RDBMS, MS SQL Server. 
- Data loading and inspection: The CSV files for order_status and KMS sql case study were imported into the RDBMS. The file KMS sql case study was renamed **Order** and will from hereon out be referred to as the Order table.  
- Updating the data type: After importing the files, updates had to be made for specific columns with decimal values on the KMS sql case study dataset. These columns include: **sales**, **discount**, **profit**, **unit _price**, **shipping_cost**, and **product_base_margin**. The purpose of this was to change them to values with 10 whole numbers and three decimal places. Here is an example of the query run for **Sales**.
```SQL
ALTER TABLE [order] 
ALTER COLUMN sales DECIMAL (10,3)
```
### Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)
This involves exploring the dataset provided to provide insights. The following are the areas where KMS requires insights to be provided:
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
- What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
- Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
- KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?
- Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?
- Which small business customer had the highest sales?
- Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012?
- Which consumer customer was the most proﬁtable one?
- Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
- If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer
### Findings From the Order Dataset
- There are repeated product ids for different products shipped to the same customers on the same day. This means that products to be delivered to any customer on the same day are issued the same product id.
- Some customers are returning customers (i.e., they names appear on our dataset more than once). We want to take note of this when trying to compute things like most valuable customers, top 3 or bottom 3 customers, etc.
### Data Analysis
This is where I have included the queries I ran and the results arrived at that will inform the insights that will be presented to the management at Kultra Mega stores.
#### ***1. Product category with the highest sales***
```SQL
SELECT TOP 1 product_category, SUM(sales) AS [Total Sales]
FROM [order]
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY [Total Sales] DESC
```
Our analysis reveals that the product category with the highest sales is **Technology** with **5984248.409**
